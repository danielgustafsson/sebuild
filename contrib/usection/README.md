This is a sample project for [seb](../../README.md) that displays how to build
a simple C application with a custom set of rules. It takes a Unicode codepoint
as argument and prints the section that character belongs to.  The sections are
defined in NamesList.txt.bz2 which has been downloaded from
[unicode.org](https://unicode.org).
